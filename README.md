# Computer-Vision-Image-Classification-Mnist-and-Cifar-10
This repository represent an introduction to computer vision by classifying images from MNIST and CIFAR 10 datasets.

In each Notebook I built an Artificial Neural Network ANN and a Convolutional Neural Network CNN and compared between their performances, and surely CNN models had better performance.
